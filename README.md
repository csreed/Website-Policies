# ColterReed.com Website Policies

My policies have been published on my website since it launched in 2013, but I thought I’d take a page from [The OmniGroup’s playbook](https://github.com/omnigroup/Customer-Policies/blob/master/README.md) and publish them on github. This way, you can see the changes I make over time.

* [Privacy Policy](Privacy%20Policy.md) — How I handle information I receive about you.
* [Comments Policy](Comments%20Policy.md) — How I treat the comments you post on this site.
* [Permissions Policty](Permissions%20Policy.md) — What you may do with content on my site without further permission and what you need explicit permission to do.
