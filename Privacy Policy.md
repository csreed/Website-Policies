# Privacy Policy

I’m not going to share your personal information with third parties.

Like most websites, the server does log that you were here. I use that information to identify which content you find the most interesting so I can provide more content like it and make this site more useful to you. I also look at things like the operating system (OS X or Windows), web browser (Safari or Chrome), and type of device you’re using (computer, phone, or tablet) to make decisions about the design of the site.

If you do not want your experience enhanced through the use of client-side javascript and cookies, you can disable those features in your browser’s settings.

This privacy policy is subject to change without notice, but I’m always going to show you the same respect I’d want to be shown if I were visiting your site. You’re my guests here. I appreciate the trust you’re showing me by spending time here, and I don’t want to violate that trust.
